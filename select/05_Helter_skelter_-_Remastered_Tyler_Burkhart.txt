It's not a matter of what I want
I guess it's part of dealing with growing up
I've got this heart of a child and mind of a man
It seems like a long day that never ends it's alright

I got a roadblock somewhere in my brain
I make it twenty days and then I fall on my face
I feel like such a fool, yea I feel so naive
But i know some day soon I'm gonna find some relief

Ain't that right?

Sometimes I'm blue when the day finally ends
I watch the sun go down and i think of my friends
And I know I'm still broken in a number of ways
But I think there's something special in embracing your pain

It's alright
Ain't that right?
